#### Learnings from Project:<a name="learnings"></a>

This project was an exploration in the features of an ecommerce store. I had to map out the shopping cart flow and use local storage to make the shopping cart page functional. I'm still working out the bugs in the project, so the user journey isn't where I want it to be yet.



#### Known Bugs <a name="bugs"></a>
- [ ] Shopping Cart feature has bug where items only show up in cart after refresh
- [ ] Layout of Shopping Cart side bar
- [ ] Delete item from cart functionality has a bug. 


#### Additional Features for future Development <a name="features"></a>
- [ ] Incorporate payment API
- [ ] Use a BAAS instead of local storage
- [ ] Add Authentication 


#### License <a name="license"></a>
